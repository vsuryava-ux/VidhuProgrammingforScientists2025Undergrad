    Build a phylogenetic tree using the UPGMA algorithm.

    Given a distance matrix and species names, iteratively merges the closest
    clusters and updates the matrix using cluster-sizeâ€“weighted averages.
    The resulting tree has `n` leaves (the species) and `n-1` internal nodes.

    Args:
        mtx (DistanceMatrix): Square symmetric matrix of pairwise distances.
        species_names (list[str]): Names of the species, in the same order as `mtx`.

    Returns:
        Tree: A list of `Node` objects representing the full UPGMA tree.
              Conventionally, the last node (index -1) is the root.
